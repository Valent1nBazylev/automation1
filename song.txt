I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars
No handlebars
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars
No handlebars
Look at me, look at me
Hands in the air like it's good to be
Alive, and I'm a famous rapper
Even when the paths are all crookedy
I can show you how to do-si-do
I can show you how to scratch a record
I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to ""
And ""
Me and my friend saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took
I can do anything that I want, 'cause, look
I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome
No metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone
On the telephone
Look at me, look at me
Just called to say that it's good to be
Alive in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read
I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a livin' off a magazine
I can design an engine
Sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline
I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic
conditions, I know how to run the business
And I can make you wanna buy a product
